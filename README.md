Mechanical engineer with more than 20 years of experience in CAE in the automotive industry. I have worked during the five past years on simulation of vehicle dynamics and ADAS, and I have very recently switched to a new experience in robotics. 

Identified by my friends and family as a petrolhead (2 and 4 wheels), I enjoy learning new things, building up and sharing knowledge, solving problems, establishing links between disciplines, confronting simulations and test results.

I also happen to be a moderate geek who enjoys coding simple tools that make repetitive tasks easier. I learned Perl at the beginning of the millenium, now trying to be as proficient in Python. I also have fun using Matlab/Simulink, and I learned PHP/MySQL only to develop my own wine cellar management tool :)

As a result I have a solid multidisciplinary background in the CAE world, with a broad perspective both on 3D and 0D/1D simulation.

In addition I speak French, English, Spanish, enough Italian to survive, Python, Matlab, Perl, Powershell, a bit of Julia and Bash

TOEIC : 975
